The Nomad...the ultimate explorer's vehicle. Forget the confines of a base, you can now roam the world and take everything with you. Equipped with a 5.56mm auto targeting turret and plenty of space for workstations and other upgrades, you'll never need another vehicle again. It might drive like a boat on land, but man can it hold stuff. Equipped with 240 slots of storage out of the box and the ability to add more when needed, you'll never need a storage box again. Craft on the go with the ability to add workstations to the vehicle.

This mod requires EAC to be disabled. Any requests for an EAC compatible version will be ignored. ONLY for 7D2D V1.0. No I will not make versions for older versions of the game. Requests will be ignored.

Nomad Features:
- Workstations
﻿- Craft workstation mods for the Nomad. Available workstations: workbench, forge, campfire, chemistry station, and cement mixer. Workstations will only ﻿craft while the vehicle is in the parked state. State can be changed using the radial menu.
- Upgradable storage
﻿- Craft two different tiers of storage upgrade to give the vehicle an extra 48 slots of storage space.
- Armor
﻿- Three different armor tiers are available. Each tier provides more protection, but slows the vehicle down.
- Bedroll
﻿- Craft a bedroll mod and your spawn point automatically sets once you get out of the stopped vehicle (NOTE: the vehicle must be completely stopped before ﻿﻿exiting or the spawnpoint won't register).
- Remote crafting
﻿- Pull materials directly from the vehicles inventory into its workbenches with the remote crafting mod.
- Remote Access
﻿- Access the Nomad's storage from up to 200 blocks away with the remote access mod.
- Zombie Detection
﻿- Three tiers of tracker modules allow you to track nearby regular, feral, and radiated zombies.
- Climate Control
﻿- Stay protected from the elements while inside the vehicle with the climate control mod.
- Navigation
﻿- Find any POI in the world with the navigator mod. When installed, bring up the navigator menu by pressing 'T' (rebindable if you have the optional Gears support installed.).
- Fuel Generator
﻿- When parked, the vehicle will slowly regenerate fuel. While in motion, this mod provides a small speed boost.
- Upgradable Turret
﻿- A 5.56mm automatic turret sits on top of the Nomad. This turret features the latest in targeting technologies. You don't even have to do anything. It will also ﻿﻿hunt animals for you. Simply provide the turret with any of the available 5.56mm ammo in the UI and turn the turret on. It'll handle the rest.
